<h3 id="a-brand-new-you">A brand NEW you</h3>

<p>Welcome to SquareOne!</p>

<p>Some of the very first things you want to do is pick out what you are going to look like.</p>

<p>Open your inventory and click the face on the upper bar to open the skin menu.</p>

<p>From this menu there are hundreds of skins to choose from.</p>

<p>While you might need to click through them one by one, there should be a skin that catches your attention. That&#39;s the skin for you.</p>

<p>You have started this game in the SPAWN. This is a central location for the server.</p>

<p>There are various <code>/shops</code> that you can use the sever currency on to buy things.</p>

<p>PVP is disabled in spawn, and if you happen to die in spawn, you keep all your stuff.</p>

<p>Once you are ready to leave spawn, head out through one of the four gates! It&#39;s that easy.</p>

<p>To return to spawn, use the command <code>/spawn</code> in chat, or press the <img src="/images/textures/inventory/go_spawn.png" alt="Go Spawn" width="48" height="48" /> button in your inventory.</p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="digging-deep-to-start-a-farm">Digging deep to start a farm</h3>

<p>Locate an area that is at least 1k blocks from another player if you plan to play solo, or start a new faction.</p>

<p>99 apples might seem like a lot of food, but there are a few things you&#39;ll need to do before you can build a farm, and harvest your own food source.</p>

<p>To place water you need to be below y+10 in the world, &amp; own the plot of land with a protection block.</p>

<div class="notices yellow">This server is big, about 30k in all directions from spawn.</div>

<p>Coordinates are <code>(x,y,z)</code>. The <code>y</code> coord, is the one that tells you how high or deep you are. The <code>x</code> coord is for East (+x) to West (-x), and <code>z</code> coord is for North (+z) and South (-z).</p>

<p>A protection block can be crafted with 8 stone, made by smelting cobblestone, and a gold ignot in the center.</p>

<p>Here is an early minshaft depth guide: - Coal is located almost everywhere in the world. - Quartz is fairly shallow at -10 below ground. - Iron ore is located roughly -50 below. - Gold ore is located -200 underground. - Mese crystal is located -600 underground.</p>

<p>There are sure to be more surprises as you go deeper.</p>

<p>This means to begin a self suffient farm you need to locate your new home, dig a mineshaft, and find gold, then return to the surface and smelt the materials needed and place the protection block, all to start a farm.</p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="food-sources-that-are-not-from-farms">Food sources that are not from farms.</h3>

<p>When you run out of apples, and you haven&#39;t found gold yet, all hope is not lost.</p>

<p>Every half hour the server automatically gives you money.</p>

<p>Located at Spawn, head south towards the south gate to find MacDonna&#39;s, which is a Shop that sells some of the basic foods.</p>

<p>Click on the signs to interact with the shop.</p>

<p>There are also beehives North of Spawn, which give free honey. Just don&#39;t punch the hive.</p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="three-homes-three-times-the-options">Three homes, three times the options!</h3>

<p>Even as a new player, you are able to use the <code>/sethome</code> command.</p>

<p>Wherever you are standing in the world, for better or for worse, will be where you teleport back to, when you use the <code>/home</code> command, or click on the <img src="/images/textures/inventory/go_home1.png" alt="Go Home 1" width="48" height="48" /> button at the bottom of your inventory screen.</p>

<p>You can place a second home teleport, again anywhere you want with <code>/sethome2</code>. This will set the location you return to when useing the <code>/home2</code> command, or clicking on the <img src="/images/textures/inventory/go_home2.png" alt="Go Home 2" width="48" height="48" /> button at the bottom of the inventory.</p>

<p>My advice is to make Home1 teleport you to the place you live and store your stuff, and be near your farm. I use Home2 for a temporary location, that changes a bunch. from a place I was out exploring, to a way to return to a place in my mine to easily get back to work collecting resources.</p>

<div class="notices blue">Protip: <img src="/images/textures/inventory/set_undo.png" alt="Set Undo" width="48" height="48" /> or <code>/sethomeundo</code> will restore the location of the last set home or home2.</div>

<p>Fhome is a shared location with your faction.</p>

<p>If you have joined or created a faction you can warp there with <code>/fhome</code> or the <img src="/images/textures/inventory/go_fhome.png" alt="Go Faction Home" width="48" height="48" /> button.</p>

<p>If you are a faction owner, you can set this location by using the command <code>/fsethome</code>.</p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="faction-basics">Faction Basics</h3>

<p>Joining or creating a faction is encouraged, but not required on SquareOne.</p>

<p>In your crafting menu, in the bottom left corner is the <img src="/images/textures/inventory/inv_settings.png" alt="Inventory Settings" width="48" height="48" /> button.</p>

<p>Clicking on this button takes you to a menu with another button <img src="/images/textures/inventory/inv_faction_menu.png" alt="Faction Menu" width="48" height="48" />. Click that.</p>

<p>In Faction Settings you can browse the Faction members and command list.</p>

<p>Clicking the <code>+</code> next to the comand displays a simple explination of the command.</p>

<p>To customize your Faction name color, use the RGB color slider below the command list.</p>

<p>You can use any color you want, but it affects what your menu color, and skybox color too. So pick your faction color carfully.</p>

<p>Color picker controls:</p>

<ul>
<li>Slide the slider left or right: this will move the color value up or down by just 1</li>
<li>Click on an empty part of the slide bar: This will move the slider to that value</li>
<li>Buttons <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> will move all three colors together, to change brightness</li>
</ul>

<p>Use these options to quickly select the color of your choice! <strong>Remember to click Save!!</strong></p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="other-forms-of-teleportation">Other forms of teleportation</h3>

<p>If you need to have someone teleport to your location, there is a comand for that. &gt; <code>/tphr [username]</code> (teleport HERE)</p>

<p>If you want to ask to teleport to someone else, use: &gt; <code>/tpr [username]</code> (teleport REQUEST)</p>

<p>The other player being asked to teleport to you, or teleport to them must agree to the teleportation.</p>

<p>They have 60 seconds to type into chat <code>/tpy</code> (teleport YES)</p>

<p>However if there was some reason they needed to deny the request, before the time runs out, they might use <code>/tpn</code> (teleport NO)</p>

<p>If you use the <code>/help</code> command there are a few other commands that start with <code>/tp*</code>.</p>

<p>There are some public warps listed.</p>

<p>For exsample <code>/bank</code> teleports you to the bank.</p>

<p><code>/18k-east</code> warps you to a place 18 thousand blocks east from spawn.</p>

<p>And importaintly <code>/shop</code> teleports you to the shop.</p>

<p>There are also teleportals underneath the spawn.</p>

<hr class="header-hr">

<h3 id="fan-lore-and-real-monsters">Fan Lore and Real Monsters?</h3>

<p>From the primordial chaos of <em>moe</em>, the SquareOne was formed. A thousand eons passed as life suddenly began to appear out of nowhere. That was when the Host, monk, came into exsistance. Blessed by <em>moe</em>, monk gained powers and ablities that drew other sentient life across the cosmos to form into Players, powerful creatures that could not only destroy but also create.</p>

<p>Decades of the sun rising and falling have brough you a Player summoned by monk to this very age, the age of <em>moe 3.0</em>. monk deputized the Police to assist with the order of the world. And the Police oversee the Guardians. No longer would a purge, war or famine cause fear or panic, at least while they are around.</p>

<p>The War that once swept the land, has caused the ocean and lake levels to plummet. Friendly mobs will randomly spawn around the Players, and if they go unclaimed will just as quickly disapear. Grass can be fed directly to sheep and cows to help tame them, but the main method to keep them around is using a nametag. Monsters mostly roam beneath the surface, lurking in the deep places of the underworld.</p>

<p>The [Land Gaurd] is a mob that spawns if a player is AFK for too long. (Away From Keyboard, a way of saying that you are idle and not around for a while.) It can spawn anywhere on the server mostly at night where there is a player who has been AFK too long nearby. Nobody knows what it looks like, the rumors say that it is as small as a mouse or as big as a Golum. Some people say that it just kicks the user off the server when it comes in contact with the player the first few times. But the Police officer tells of a darker blood lust, where the Land Gaurdian is only a vicious player killer that can kill the most well equipt player in just two hits, sounding off a creepy laugh before it strikes. If you plan to be AFK on the server keep it short; and if you find this creature, RUN!</p>

<p>Most monsters spawn below -1000 depth. But there are pools of lava found above there that can spawn something like [Lava snowmen] (not the actual name but rather a description.) These foul fire elementals spawn in the light near lava. To have any hope of surviving an early encounter with these lava blobs, it is recomended to have a full set of Steel armor (Steel is just smelted iron ore in SquareOne). No other mobs spawn above -1000. Maybe someday this scardy pants guide will look down there and write an guide for advanced players. But that is all my current knowledge of the monsters of this world.</p>

<p>Arguably, the real threat doesn&#39;t come from monsters, which do appear in a rare chance, they are easily escaped. The reason to fear what lurks in the night on the surface of SquareOne, comes from other players.</p>
