<h3 class="header-separator">Dec 29 | Raffle Winner</h3>

<p>This year&#39;s Gingerbread Cookie Raffle was both exciting, and anti-climactic!</p>

<p>Three names were drawn in total, the first two were no-shows causing disqualification.</p>

<p><strong>grey_slay</strong> was the first picked name, logged in 10 hours after being disqualified.</p>

<p><strong>Walfey</strong> was the second picked name, logged in 5 days after being disqualified.</p>

<p>The final name to be drawn, whom became the winner of the $15,988 prize was <strong>ItzCookie</strong>!</p>

<p>When asked to give their decision on whether to split the prize and draw a second winner, there was no hesitation:</p>

<p><code>&lt;ItzCookie&gt; ill keep it</code></p>

<p>Followed by a full <em>26 seconds of silence</em>.</p>

<p>And that was it, contest ended.</p>

<p>ItzCookie ended up sharing a lot of the prize with friends and others who asked.</p>

<p>Congratulations again, and better luck to all participants next year!</p>

<h1 id="december-3-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">Dec 3 | Etherium Sword</h3>

<p>Kind of a late update on this one, the Etherium Sword, which had been on the back burner since late 2023, has finally been introduced in-game.</p>

<p>Etherium Sword ability is in line with the Anti-Gravity effect of Etherium Armor, and incurs an inversion of gravity on the player being struck by this sword, plus a knockback boost. Wearing full Gold armor, which adds gravity to the player, will be knocked back significantly more than full Etherium armor, which reduces gravity of the player.</p>

<p>Additionally, the knockback system now includes actual physics! <em>Relative Motion</em> considers the magnitude and direction of velocity of the players in combat. In plain terms, running towards and hitting another player will cause greater knockback than standing still and hitting them.</p>

<p>The PvP Arena, inspired by senua&#39;s PvP area, is found at x300,z-70, which is east of spawn. At this time there are no PvP tournaments planned, but the idea is lingering in my mind.</p>

<p>Also, the <a href="/pages/map.html">map images</a> have been updated and expanded to show up to x/z:16384. Keep in mind, areas of white will show up in colored detail when they are generated in-game in subsequent updates to these images.</p>

<p>Finally, the second annual Gingerbread Cookie Raffle prize lot is sitting at over $11,000! The draw is now less than a month away, be ready to hear the announced First draw winner. <a href="/pages/raffle.html">Click here for more details</a>.</p>

<h1 id="october-12-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">October 12 | XM Repurposed</h3>

<p>The chat command for proximity chat, <code>/xm</code> has been repurposed into a group chat command.</p>

<p>To create a new xm group, use <code>/xm_new</code>. All xm groups are created without ownership. If the creator of an xm group leaves the group they created, it doesn&#39;t matter. The xm group will exist until there are no members in the group.</p>

<p>XM groups are accessed by invite only. Anyone can invite anyone into an XM group, and a member will remain a member of the group they join until they leave.</p>

<p>To invite another player into your XM group, use <code>/xm_invite player_name</code>.</p>

<p>To accept an invite, use <code>/xm_join</code>. To decline, simply ignore the invite.</p>

<p>Leave an XM group with <code>/xm_leave</code>. There is no kick option here, if you don&#39;t want someone in your XM group, leave the group and start a new one.</p>

<p>To see the list of members in your group, use <code>/xm_list</code>. Include another player&#39;s name to check their XM group list, <code>/xm_list player_name</code>.</p>

<p>And finally, to chat: <code>/xm</code>. XM chat works anywhere in-game, no longer restricted by distance. Since this is a non-public chat stream, the new XM chats are no longer monitored by staff and they are not processed through the chat filter.</p>

<p>There is currently no persistance of the groups or members, however this will be implemented soon along with other minor tweaks such as announcing when someone has invited someone.</p>

<h1 id="october-7-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">October 7 | Automatic Crafting</h3>

<p>Auto-Craft has been added.</p>

<p>To auto-craft, the player must be standing within 3 nodes of a workbench and have sufficient ingredient supply in their inventory.</p>

<p>While standing next to the workbench, open your inventory and add a recipe to the craft grid.</p>

<p>Auto-craft will continue to craft one of the last recipe crafted every second, and will continue until the player walks away from the workbench or until there are no more ingredients in their inventory.</p>

<p>Be careful! If your inventory is too full, the auto-craft will drop the items at your feet.</p>

<p>Crafting the same recipe along with the auto-craft is possible, however crafting something different will also change the auto-craft recipe.</p>

<h1 id="august-30-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">August 30 | Personalized Tools</h3>

<p>Tools which are able to level up, pickaxes, axes, swords, shovels, etc, will now show the player&#39;s name after being a level up!</p>

<p>Yes! New tools and old tools will receive the mark of ownership on the tool after a level up. Any level 0 tools will not show a player&#39;s name.</p>

<p>This change is not applied retroactively, therefore any tools with a level will still need to gain one level before receiving the mark of ownership.</p>

<p>Also, the Mese and Mitril Pickax have had their digtimes swapped. Meaning Mithril pick now digs faster than Mese. The page with <a href="/pages/tools.html">tool digtimes</a> will be updated soon with <em>accurate</em> stats.</p>

<h1 id="august-4-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">August 4 | EXP Balance Update</h3>

<ul>
<li>It will be <strong>more difficult to gain exp</strong>, and rewards balanced gameplay instead of a purely action-based gain system.</li>
<li>Uses the player&#39;s <strong>existing AP and OT points</strong>, no changes to the method of contributing towards exp</li>
<li>The most noticeable change will be your <strong>exp and levels are reduced</strong></li>
<li>Using /bones carries an <strong>actual risk</strong> of loss</li>
</ul>

<p>There&#39;s also going to be changes to node drops, tying into the exp mod.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blue diamonds no longer have a depth restriction</strong>. Mining stone is still the primary source of diamonds.</li>
<li>Luck and Fortune <strong>will affect more node drops</strong>.</li>
<li>If a node is to drop an item, a luck throw will be used to determine if you will receive a multiplier based <strong>directly on your fortune stat</strong>.</li>
<li>For example, after a successful Luck throw, and your fortune is between 3.0 and 3.99, you may receive up to 5 items as a drop.</li>
</ul>

<p>And we&#39;re plugging the mobs drops into this mechanic as well.</p>

<h1 id="july-21-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">July 21 | Mandated Taxes and Chat Filter Update</h3>

<p>&quot;Profit Sharing&quot; has been an optional feature of shops for the last 9 months. It will now be mandated for all shops, and any shop selling items for cash will automatically contribute 10% of their cash sales towards the half-hourly money drops.</p>

<p>What to expect:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a shop selling items for cash, you will receive 90% of the cash sale

<ul>
<li>Example: if you sell gold for $10, each sale gives you $9</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The server 30 minute money drops will give more than $10 more frequently</li>
<li>Everyone will complain about it, but in the long run they will have more money to spend</li>
</ul>

<p>For more details about the shop taxes, <a href="/pages/economy.html">click here</a></p>

<p>And yes, another chat filter update. I don&#39;t have much to say about it. It should be better than the last one, but I always say that.</p>

<h1 id="june-24-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">June 24 | Add Lantern Slabs and Improved Textures</h3>

<p>A few nodes were missing from the available slabs, have been added:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obsidian Frosted Glass</li>
<li>Obsidian Lantern</li>
<li>Cobble Brick</li>
<li>Wooden Lightbox (white and yellow)</li>
</ul>

<p>These textures were also updated:</p>

<ul>
<li>White Granite (also recipe gives 4 instead of 1)</li>
<li>Birch wood</li>
<li>Healing wood</li>
<li>Willow wood</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, the coloredblocks mod. Completely re-written to make it easier to add new nodes, and create individual colored textures without relying on the engine modifiers to colorize a greyscale template.</p>

<p>This also comes with a new block: Colored Obsidian Frosted Glass! So pretty.</p>

<p><img src="/images/other/game_textures/Screenshot_2025-06-24_11-09-16.png" alt="Screenshot of Colored Blocks" /></p>

<h1 id="june-14-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">June 14 | Armor Buffs</h3>

<p>Mythril has long been a rare and useless item. It&#39;s harder to find than diamonds, and has a market value of roughly $5 per lump. To offset this, the armor stat for mythril has been buffed, by increasing the block chance to around 5%.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Pink Crystal boots have gained the ability to &quot;walk&quot; over single nodes. This will be noticed primarily by PC players, since some mobile apps have had this functionality for a while. Wearing the Pink Crystal boots will let players walk and step over single blocks without having to jump.</p>

<h1 id="may-27-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">May 27 | Celebrating SquareOne Year Two!</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>New Posters</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>In recognition of the server&#39;s second year anniversary, four new posters are available for purchase in the spawn willow shop (the potions shop). This year&#39;s themes are &#39;mosaic&#39; and &#39;cascading text&#39;.</p>

<p>Limited Edition, Only 2025 of each will be distributed!</p>

<h1 id="may-13-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">May 13 | Chat and Filter Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Useless chat filter</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The old one sucked, this one sucks a little less. You still can&#39;t use caps, but you can say &#39;100000000&#39; without it turning into &#39;100&#39;. Thie updated version was completely re-written, which means there could be some bugs.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Proximity Chat</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>A new command for players, <code>/xm</code> is another way to group chat. This one will only send to players within 100 nodes, and will show as cyan-colored text with.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Toggle Chat</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Ignore everyone while staying available with <code>/chat</code>. This command will silence the public channel, while allowing private and faction and proximity chat.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Useless EXP</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Not anymore! Your Level stat will now show as your nametag flair.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Simplified /block</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Just use <code>/block player_name</code> to pretend like player_name doesn&#39;t even exist. Do it yourself before staff does it for you.</p>

<p>To see who you&#39;ve blocked, just type <code>/block</code>. Staff can also now see your block list with the same command.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Outgoing Private Messages</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Private messages will show as blue when you send it, and green when you receive. The notification of being unable to send due to &#39;active block-list&#39; has also been removed. Now, you&#39;ll never know why player_name doesn&#39;t answer you.</p>

<h1 id="may-2-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">May 2 | EXP and Bones Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Balanced gains/losses</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Adjusted the formula used to calculate your EXP and Levels. This should better reflect established players Level, while also giving noobs a lot of chances to die without suffering too many losses.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Dying is more risky</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Using <code>/bones</code> now has a minimum of 100 exp. This sounds like a lot, but it isn&#39;t anymore.</p>

<p>When you use <code>/bones</code>, there is still a chance of not losing EXP based on your Luck.</p>

<p>Your Luck decides if you pay, and Fortune determines the amount of EXP lost. Check the <a href="/pages/exp.html">EXP Page</a> for full details.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Dropping bones in someone else&#39;s protected area</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>If you die in someone else&#39;s protected area (in other words, not your own protected area, or not in a unprotected), don&#39;t worry about your bones because you won&#39;t drop them. You also won&#39;t be able to use <code>/bones</code> to return to your death position, so tread carefully in a stranger&#39;s property.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Spawn: 3</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The Bank is now open. The Library is now Open. The Potions Shop (Willow Tree Shop) is now Open. The Clothing Store is now Open. The Post Office is finally open.</p>

<p>To apply for a mailbox in the Post Office: <em>Read and follow the instructions in the book at front entrance</em>!</p>

<p><img src="/images/squareone_spawn.png" alt="Spawn Image" /></p>

<p>There&#39;s probably more but I&#39;m done with typing.</p>

<h1 id="april-28-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">April 28 2025 | Mods Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Abandoned Protector Patch</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Nodes which are now affected by the abandoned protector mechanic:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mailbox (Red Cube)</li>
<li>Inbox (White Round)</li>
<li>Shopsign</li>
</ul>

<p>The items in an abandoned shop can only be removed from the shop. Items cannot be moved within the shop, neither can items be moved into the shop.</p>

<p>Patched a bug caused by placing protector blocks on an abandoned protector too quickly; <a href="https://github.com/monk-afk/SquareOne/issues/46">see issue #46</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Clearobjects caused the removal of some animals</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, the command was not able to clear the objects from the entire world; some animals were removed while others were not.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Old spawn demolished!</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The spawn build was an impressive structure. I loved telling people that it was built using mathematics and explain how spawn was a <a href="/scripts/spawn_build.lua">Menger Cube twisted by a Fibonacci Spiral</a></p>

<p>However, building inside the spawn building was becoming increasingly frustrating. There was no place to build, despite being 6 stories high; and it was oddly shaped, having almost no symmetry.</p>

<p>Now, I have room to build stuff.</p>

<h1 id="april-14-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">April 14 2025 | Announcement</h3>

<p>(Ammended May 5 2025)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>A new regulation implemented in relation to the abandoned protector mechanic.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<div class="notices red">Do not protect abandonned builds, unless you will live in it</div>

<p>If there are disputes over abandoned builds, or if multiple players chaotically protect an abandoned area into a state where it cannot be built upon, we will demolish the area.</p>

<h1 id="april-8-2025"></h1>

<h3 class="header-separator">April 8 2025 | Mods Update</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><em>Abandonned Protectors has been re-enabled</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Still gotta wait 9 months for a protector to become abandonned.</li>
<li>If you place your own pblock where it would overlap the abandoned pblock, the ownership of the abandoned pblock is automatically changed to your name.</li>
<li>To discourage vulture-like behaviour, the /when or /last-login command has been limited to show the player&#39;s login within the last 30 days, or simply &quot;more than 30 days&quot;.</li>
<li>Additionally, the &#39;Last Seen&#39; display when standing in a protected area will not show the player&#39;s last login. Only <em>after</em> the protector is abandoned will it show the last login.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Bones Protecting</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Due to the amount of protecting bones happening, pblocks are no longer able to be placed where there are fresh bones.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Faction-Shared Protectors</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Has been reinstated.</li>
<li>Click the checkbox to share your area.</li>
<li>PVP will be enabled for faction members of the shared protector</li>
<li>The owner is not immune to damage when attacked from a faction member inside a faction shared protector area.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Farming Limitation</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Players will no longer be able to place seeds within 700 blocks from Spawn.

<ul>
<li>Previously, it was possible to place seed, but nothing would grow.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Hopefully that fixes the issue of crystal grass not growing anywhere</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
