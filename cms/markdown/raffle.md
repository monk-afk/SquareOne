# GingerBread Cookie Raffle

## Total Prize Lot $15,988

___

### Gingerbread cookies are $1 each

All the money from gingerbread cookie sales at the `Spawn Shop`, where potions and time stones are sold, are added to the prize lot.

Purchasing **any amount** of cookies adds your name to the list of contestants (restrictions on alt-accounts and inactive players apply). This means:

- Buy 1 cookie = 1 entry = +$1 to the prize
- Buy 1000 cookies = 1 entry = +$1000 to the prize

___

### Keep or Split

First drawn winner is given a choice:

  - *Keep the entire prize*
      - or
  - *Split the prize in half with another winner*

*If they keep* the entire prize, **the raffle ends**.

*If they split* the prize with another winner, **a second name is drawn** and they are given the same choice as the first winner.

Drawing winners will continue until someone chooses to keep the entire prize, or until the resulting division from the last choice is a minimum of $250.

Visual example, if the total prize money is $5,000 and every winner decides to split the prize:

::: {.notices .green}
$5000 (First winner, receives $2500)<br>
&nbsp;└─ $2500 (Second winner, receives $1250)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ $1250 (Third, $625)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ $625 (Fourth, $312)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└─ $312 (Last winner, can't split to make next winner $250)
:::

If the first winner decides *keep the prize*:

::: {.notices .red}
$5000 (First winner, receives $5000)<br>
&nbsp;└─ Game over.
