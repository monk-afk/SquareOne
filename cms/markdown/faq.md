### Can I get a mailbox at spawn?{#faq-can-i-get-a-mailbox-at-spawn}

To apply for a mailbox in the Spawn Post-Office, please follow the instructions listed in the book next to the applications mailbox. The requirements are as followed:

  1. Only one mailbox per player. No ALT accounts, no sibling accounts.
  2. Player must be active with a minimum of 6 weeks account created.
  3. Drop a book with the **Coordinates to your Home location**.
    - Find the coordinates from the inventory settings.
  4. I forget the rest and will update this later.
  5. Pretty sure there are 5 items on the list.

___

### What is the password?{#faq-what-is-the-password}

There is no default password. Players choose their own password when the username is registered. If you try to log on and it says "Wrong Password", that means the username belongs to someone else.

### How do I change my skin?{#faq-how-do-i-change-my-skin}

Open your inventory: the face on top is a button, tap it to change skin

___

### Why can't I find diamonds?{#faq-why-cant-i-find-diamonds}

Diamond and Pink Diamond are only found randomly from digging stone, similar to finding bones from digging soil.

A complete list of drops and frequencies can be found on the [mining page](/mining.html)

### What is the best armor?{#faq-what-is-the-best-armor}

Every armor type has advantage and disadvantage. Armor stats are found here: https://monk-afk.github.io/SquareOne/armor.html

___

### Make it day/night!{#faq-make-it-daynight}

Time stones are sold at spawn.

Using time stones will move the game day forward.

- `Day stone` set time to 06:00
- `Night stone` set time to 18:00

One game-day is normally 30 real-time minutes.

- `Timeless pearl` stops time 30 minutes

The game day is displayed in the inventory menu.

___

### Why won't anything grow?{#faq-why-wont-anything-grow}

- Farming within 700 of Spawn is disabled.
- Any seed planted will not grow.
- Exceptions for trees, and dirt with grass.

___

### Why can't I place water?{#faq-why-cant-i-place-water}

The top limit for placing water with a bucket is y+10.

Water cannot be made into an source, and picking up water from an ocean will not self-replenish.

For farming you have two options:
  - Plant crops anywhere below y+10, or
  - Use irrigation items, (well, barrel, reservoir)

___

### Why is the water disappearing?{#faq-why-is-the-water-disappearing}

The water is currently going through a reduction from y+2 to y-8 in order to increase the exposed land, because there was just way too much water.

___

### How do I fill the well?{#faq-how-do-i-fill-the-well}

You dont.
  - A well will fill itself over time
  - A full well will supply 100 buckets of water
  - It takes 24 hours to full (14.4 minutes for 1 bucket)
