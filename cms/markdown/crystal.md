# Crystal

There are two types of Crystal: Pink and Blue.

Crystal biomes can be found on the world surface, as well as in caves underground.

Pink Crystal only spawns at night, between 20:00 and 02:00 in-game time (at night).

Blue Crystal spawns outside of those hours, in the daytime.

Crystal grass will crystalize into spikes almost anywhere above or underground.

Crystals will *not* grow within 700 nodes of Spawn.

There is no minimum light for crystal grass to crystalize.

Pink Crystal will spawn along with a Pink Crystal Dirt node; it does not spread like normal grassy dirt.

Sometimes a Salt Crystal will spawn
