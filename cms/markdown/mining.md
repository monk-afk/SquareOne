# Mining

**Public Mines**

There are three public mine locations. Use the `tpp` chat command to travel:

**Diamonds**

Diamonds can only be found below a certain depth, and only by chance from digging stone.

| Diamond | Minimum depth | Rarity     |
|:-------:|:--------------|-----------:|
| Pink    |         -8200 | 0.000114%% |
| Blue    |         -1024 | 0.000598%% |

**Extra Drops**

If a node normally drops an item, this list details extra items drop potentials.

The rarity number means "1 in X" chance to drop.

Your luck and fortune stats do not affect the potentiality a node drops, but it [does affect the amount of the reward dropped](/pages/exp.html).
