# Recent Updates

### Feb 22 | Late update {.header-separator}

There are now 147 table variants, most wood types, and acrylics. More will will be added.

The crafting guide does not show all 147, they are however all crafted with the same recipe.

```
- B = Block (wood, acryilic, etc)
- S = Stick
_____________
| B | B | B |
| S |   | S |
| S |   | S |
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
```

The Irrigation mod also has been updated to add 'Pipes'!

Connect pipes to a water reservoir to extend the water range from the source up to 15 blocks!

And lastly, *all the dyes* recipes now can be found using the crafting guide in-game, finally.

I've also been considering not writing these updates since they're usually late.
