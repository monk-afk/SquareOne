# Recent Updates

### October 12 | XM Repurposed {.header-separator}

The chat command for proximity chat, `/xm` has been repurposed into a group chat command.

To create a new xm group, use `/xm_new`. All xm groups are created without ownership. If the creator of an xm group leaves the group they created, it doesn't matter. The xm group will exist until there are no members in the group.

XM groups are accessed by invite only. Anyone can invite anyone into an XM group, and a member will remain a member of the group they join until they leave.

To invite another player into your XM group, use `/xm_invite player_name`.

To accept an invite, use `/xm_join`. To decline, simply ignore the invite.

Leave an XM group with `/xm_leave`. There is no kick option here, if you don't want someone in your XM group, leave the group and start a new one.

To see the list of members in your group, use `/xm_list`. Include another player's name to check their XM group list, `/xm_list player_name`.

And finally, to chat: `/xm`. XM chat works anywhere in-game, no longer restricted by distance. Since this is a non-public chat stream, the new XM chats are no longer monitored by staff and they are not processed through the chat filter.

There is currently no persistance of the groups or members, however this will be implemented soon along with other minor tweaks such as announcing when someone has invited someone.

### October 7 | Automatic Crafting {.header-separator}

Auto-Craft has been added.

To auto-craft, the player must be standing within 3 nodes of a workbench and have sufficient ingredient supply in their inventory.

While standing next to the workbench, open your inventory and add a recipe to the craft grid.

Auto-craft will continue to craft one of the last recipe crafted every second, and will continue until the player walks away from the workbench or until there are no more ingredients in their inventory.

Be careful! If your inventory is too full, the auto-craft will drop the items at your feet.

Crafting the same recipe along with the auto-craft is possible, however crafting something different will also change the auto-craft recipe.

### August 30 | Personalized Tools {.header-separator}

Tools which are able to level up, pickaxes, axes, swords, shovels, etc, will now show the player's name after being a level up!

Yes! New tools and old tools will receive the mark of ownership on the tool after a level up. Any level 0 tools will not show a player's name.

This change is not applied retroactively, therefore any tools with a level will still need to gain one level before receiving the mark of ownership.

Also, the Mese and Mitril Pickax have had their digtimes swapped. Meaning Mithril pick now digs faster than Mese. The page with [tool digtimes](/pages/tools.html) will be updated soon with *accurate* stats.

### August 4 | EXP Balance Update {.header-separator}

- It will be **more difficult to gain exp**, and rewards balanced gameplay instead of a purely action-based gain system.
- Uses the player's **existing AP and OT points**, no changes to the method of contributing towards exp
- The most noticeable change will be your **exp and levels are reduced**
- Using /bones carries an **actual risk** of loss

There's also going to be changes to node drops, tying into the exp mod. 

- **Blue diamonds no longer have a depth restriction**. Mining stone is still the primary source of diamonds.
- Luck and Fortune **will affect more node drops**. 
- If a node is to drop an item, a luck throw will be used to determine if you will receive a multiplier based **directly on your fortune stat**. 
  - For example, after a successful Luck throw, and your fortune is between 3.0 and 3.99, you may receive up to 5 items as a drop.

And we're plugging the mobs drops into this mechanic as well.
