# Recent Updates

### August 30 | Personalized Tools {.header-separator}

Tools which are able to level up, pickaxes, axes, swords, shovels, etc, will now show the player's name after being a level up!

Yes! New tools and old tools will receive the mark of ownership on the tool after a level up. Any level 0 tools will not show a player's name.

This change is not applied retroactively, therefore any tools with a level will still need to gain one level before receiving the mark of ownership.

Also, the Mese and Mitril Pickax have had their digtimes swapped. Meaning Mithril pick now digs faster than Mese. The page with [tool digtimes](/pages/tools.html) will be updated soon with *accurate* stats.

### August 4 | EXP Balance Update {.header-separator}

- It will be **more difficult to gain exp**, and rewards balanced gameplay instead of a purely action-based gain system.
- Uses the player's **existing AP and OT points**, no changes to the method of contributing towards exp
- The most noticeable change will be your **exp and levels are reduced**
- Using /bones carries an **actual risk** of loss

There's also going to be changes to node drops, tying into the exp mod. 

- **Blue diamonds no longer have a depth restriction**. Mining stone is still the primary source of diamonds.
- Luck and Fortune **will affect more node drops**. 
- If a node is to drop an item, a luck throw will be used to determine if you will receive a multiplier based **directly on your fortune stat**. 
  - For example, after a successful Luck throw, and your fortune is between 3.0 and 3.99, you may receive up to 5 items as a drop.

And we're plugging the mobs drops into this mechanic as well.

### July 21 | Mandated Taxes and Chat Filter Update {.header-separator}

"Profit Sharing" has been an optional feature of shops for the last 9 months. It will now be mandated for all shops, and any shop selling items for cash will automatically contribute 10%% of their cash sales towards the half-hourly money drops.

What to expect:

  - If you have a shop selling items for cash, you will receive 90%% of the cash sale
    - Example: if you sell gold for $10, each sale gives you $9
  - The server 30 minute money drops will give more than $10 more frequently
  - Everyone will complain about it, but in the long run they will have more money to spend

And yes, another chat filter update. I don't have much to say about it. It should be better than the last one, but I always say that.
