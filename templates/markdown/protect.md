# Protection Blocks

Players can protect their area from griefing with protection blocks (pblock).

A pblock will cover an area of 15 cubic meters (nodes).

Tap on the pblock, or tap on the ground with a pblock, to momentarily show the area's protected borders.

### PvP

When a player is within the borders of a protected area, they are only able to inflict PvP damage on another player *if they own* the protected area. Otherwise, PvP is not enabled for players who stand in protected areas not owned by themselves.

|   | inside pB zone? | is pB owner? | Can cause damage? | Can receive damage? | Will drop bones? |

### Abandonned Protectors

When in an abandonned state, everything, including the pblock, can be picked up by other players.

Protector Abandonment is automatic after 9 months of not joining the server.

::: {.notices .yellow}
The abandon state only affects the protector blocks, not the player data. Account information, such as passwords and inventories, are **not** affected.
:::

If the owner of an abandonned area returns after 9 months, remaining pblocks will be re-activated.

::: {.notices .red}
Do not protect abandonned builds, unless you will live in it
:::

If there are disputes over abandoned builds, or if multiple players chaotically protect an abandoned area into a state where it cannot be built upon, we will demolish the area.

::: {.notices .green}
Please consider scavenging the whole build, as to not leave a mess of half-destroyed builds everywhere.
