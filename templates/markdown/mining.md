# Mining

**Public Mines**

There are two public mine locations. Use the `tpp` chat command to travel:

> `/tpp mine1`
> `/tpp mine2`

**Diamonds**

Diamonds can only be found below a certain depth, and only by chance from digging stone.

| Diamond | Minimum depth | Rarity     |
|:-------:|:--------------|-----------:|
| Pink    |         -8200 | 0.000114%% |
| Blue    |         -1024 | 0.000598%% |

**Extra Drops**

If a node normally drops an item, this list details extra items drop potentials.

The rarity number means "1 in X" chance to drop.

Your luck and fortune stats do not affect the potentiality of drops.

If an item is listed twice, like copper, it means there are two chances per dig.
