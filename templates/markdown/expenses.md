# Expenses

This table destails the income and expenses incurred from hosting SquareOne. Many people have asked how much it costs to run the server, so I took the time to compile the invoices related to the server.

The best way you can support SquareOne is a simple "thanks monk" in-game, or drop me a word of encouragement in my mailbox at spawn, these gestures mean a lot to me.

I also won't say no to a cold hard cash deposit.
