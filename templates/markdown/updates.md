# Recent Updates

### July 21 | Mandated Taxes and Chat Filter Update {.header-separator}

"Profit Sharing" has been an optional feature of shops for the last 9 months. It will now be mandated for all shops, and any shop selling items for cash will automatically contribute 10%% of their cash sales towards the half-hourly money drops.

What to expect:

  - If you have a shop selling items for cash, you will receive 90%% of the cash sale
    - Example: if you sell gold for $10, each sale gives you $9
  - The server 30 minute money drops will give more than $10 more frequently
  - Everyone will complain about it, but in the long run they will have more money to spend

And yes, another chat filter update. I don't have much to say about it. It should be better than the last one, but I always say that.

### June 24 | Add Lantern Slabs and Improved Textures {.header-separator}

A few nodes were missing from the available slabs, have been added:

- Obsidian Frosted Glass
- Obsidian Lantern
- Cobble Brick
- Wooden Lightbox (white and yellow)

These textures were also updated:

- White Granite (also recipe gives 4 instead of 1)
- Birch wood
- Healing wood
- Willow wood

And finally, the coloredblocks mod. Completely re-written to make it easier to add new nodes, and create individual colored textures without relying on the engine modifiers to colorize a greyscale template.

This also comes with a new block: Colored Obsidian Frosted Glass! So pretty.

### June 14 | Armor Buffs {.header-separator}

Mythril has long been a rare and useless item. It's harder to find than diamonds, and has a market value of roughly $5 per lump. To offset this, the armor stat for mythril has been buffed, by increasing the block chance to around 5%%.

Additionally, the Pink Crystal boots have gained the ability to "walk" over single nodes. This will be noticed primarily by PC players, since some mobile apps have had this functionality for a while. Wearing the Pink Crystal boots will let players walk and step over single blocks without having to jump.


### May 27 | Celebrating SquareOne Year Two! {.header-separator}

- ***New Posters***

In recognition of the server's second year anniversary, four new posters are available for purchase in the spawn willow shop (the potions shop). This year's themes are 'mosaic' and 'cascading text'.

### May 13 | Chat and Filter Update {.header-separator}

- ***Useless chat filter***

The old one sucked, this one sucks a little less. You still can't use caps, but you can say '100000000' without it turning into '100'. Thie updated version was completely re-written, which means there could be some bugs.

- ***Proximity Chat***

A new command for players, `/xm` is another way to group chat. This one will only send to players within 100 nodes, and will show as cyan-colored text with.

- ***Toggle Chat***

Ignore everyone while staying available with `/chat`. This command will silence the public channel, while allowing private and faction and proximity chat.

- ***Useless EXP***

Not anymore! Your Level stat will now show as your nametag flair.

- ***Simplified /block***

Just use `/block player_name` to pretend like player_name doesn't even exist. Do it yourself before staff does it for you.

To see who you've blocked, just type `/block`. Staff can also now see your block list with the same command.

- ***Outgoing Private Messages***

Private messages will show as blue when you send it, and green when you receive. The notification of being unable to send due to 'active block-list' has also been removed. Now, you'll never know why player_name doesn't answer you.
