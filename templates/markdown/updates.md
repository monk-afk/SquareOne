# Recent Updates

### August 4 | EXP Balance Update {.header-separator}

- It will be **more difficult to gain exp**, and rewards balanced gameplay instead of a purely action-based gain system.
- Uses the player's **existing AP and OT points**, no changes to the method of contributing towards exp
- The most noticeable change will be your **exp and levels are reduced**
- Using /bones carries an **actual risk** of loss

There's also going to be changes to node drops, tying into the exp mod. 

- **Blue diamonds no longer have a depth restriction**. Mining stone is still the primary source of diamonds.
- Luck and Fortune **will affect more node drops**. 
- If a node is to drop an item, a luck throw will be used to determine if you will receive a multiplier based **directly on your fortune stat**. 
  - For example, after a successful Luck throw, and your fortune is between 3.0 and 3.99, you may receive up to 5 items as a drop.

And we're plugging the mobs drops into this mechanic as well.

### July 21 | Mandated Taxes and Chat Filter Update {.header-separator}

"Profit Sharing" has been an optional feature of shops for the last 9 months. It will now be mandated for all shops, and any shop selling items for cash will automatically contribute 10%% of their cash sales towards the half-hourly money drops.

What to expect:

  - If you have a shop selling items for cash, you will receive 90%% of the cash sale
    - Example: if you sell gold for $10, each sale gives you $9
  - The server 30 minute money drops will give more than $10 more frequently
  - Everyone will complain about it, but in the long run they will have more money to spend

And yes, another chat filter update. I don't have much to say about it. It should be better than the last one, but I always say that.

### June 24 | Add Lantern Slabs and Improved Textures {.header-separator}

A few nodes were missing from the available slabs, have been added:

- Obsidian Frosted Glass
- Obsidian Lantern
- Cobble Brick
- Wooden Lightbox (white and yellow)

These textures were also updated:

- White Granite (also recipe gives 4 instead of 1)
- Birch wood
- Healing wood
- Willow wood

And finally, the coloredblocks mod. Completely re-written to make it easier to add new nodes, and create individual colored textures without relying on the engine modifiers to colorize a greyscale template.

This also comes with a new block: Colored Obsidian Frosted Glass! So pretty.

### June 14 | Armor Buffs {.header-separator}

Mythril has long been a rare and useless item. It's harder to find than diamonds, and has a market value of roughly $5 per lump. To offset this, the armor stat for mythril has been buffed, by increasing the block chance to around 5%%.

Additionally, the Pink Crystal boots have gained the ability to "walk" over single nodes. This will be noticed primarily by PC players, since some mobile apps have had this functionality for a while. Wearing the Pink Crystal boots will let players walk and step over single blocks without having to jump.
