### Profit Sharing

Profit Sharing is a way for shop owners to give back a portion of their shop profit.

Members of Profit Sharing contribute 10%% of their shop sales towards server money drops.

Shared profits are distributed when there is enough collection to give every online player at least $10 on top of the regular $10 half-hour money drops.

For example, if there are 10 players online, there must be at lease $100 pending payout to give everyone $10 at the next money drop.

Profit Sharing shops can be distinguished from normal shops by the customer interface, which is customised with the shop owner's name and faction color.
