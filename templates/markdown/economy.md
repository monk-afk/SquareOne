### Market

Most of the server's economy is driven by sales from Shop signs.

Players may choose to sell items for cash or trade with another item.

```/market``` view the real-time market-price averages.

Every cash sale contributes to the moving average.

___

### Money Drops

Every 30 minutes, players receive a base amount of $10 deposited into their inventory wallet.

The inventory wallet can hold up to 99 notes.

___

### Profit Sharing Tax

Shop signs (aka. smartshop) contribute a 10%% tax towards the server half-hour money drops.

Only cash sales are taxed. Any bartering, or item-for-item sales are not taxed.

For the pending amount to be paid, there must be at least enough to give each online player at minimum an additional $10 on top of the regular $10 half-hour money drop.

Any surplus is also distributed up to a maximum of $90 + regular drop.

For example, if there are 10 players online, there must be at least $100 pending payout to give everyone $10 at the next money drop.

```/profit-share``` show the amount of collected taxes pending next payout.

Shop owners can expect to receive $9 for every $10 sale.
